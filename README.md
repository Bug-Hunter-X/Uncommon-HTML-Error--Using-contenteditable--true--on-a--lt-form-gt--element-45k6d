# Uncommon HTML Error: Using contenteditable="true" on a &lt;form&gt; element

This repository demonstrates an uncommon error in HTML: using the `contenteditable="true"` attribute on a &lt;form&gt; element.  This is generally not recommended and can lead to unpredictable behavior.  While it might work in some browsers, it's not a standard practice and could cause issues with form submission and data handling.  The solution demonstrates the correct way to handle editable content within a form, using separate editable elements instead of modifying the entire form's behavior.
